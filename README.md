# starwars
[Yesterday 15:42] Daniel Jew
   Exercise:The data in this database has been pulled fromhttps://swapi.dev/. As well as 'people', the API has data on starships. 
   In Python, pull data on all available starships from the API. The "pilots" key contains URLs pointing to the characters who pilot the starship. 
   Use these to replace 'pilots' with a list of ObjectIDs from our characters collection, then insert the starships into their own collection. 
   Use functions at the very least!
